			<h1>Best Car and Truck Poems</h1>
			<p>In my line of work, I have to know a little about cars.
			Enough at least to talk to a mechanic or body man without being laughed 
			out of the shop. And enough to know what it is that’s broken on a car that’s more 
			usefully descriptive than “that 
			little red piece next to the black piece that kind of has a little curve in it.”</p>

				He said he could fix it up.

					Do you cry

					I dance inside,
					sometimes I risk it driving—
					bow my head and shake
					where the clear notes sound tenor up the neck,
					bass in a tin can like a kick
